		<h3>Success!</h3>
		<p>
			Sorry to hear you can't make it. Notifying absences is often looked down upon by most participants due to inconveincing everyone's schedules, so please try to keep it to a minimum.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Please add a comment in the date conversation as to why you may be absent as this will notify users of your circumstances and resolve the issue
			</strong>
			<br/><br/>
			<small><strong>*Note:</strong> Notifying an absence means your previously occupied spot is now available for anyone to join. If you find out later you can join, then you may need to post a message in the date conversation to resolve if someone else has taken your place
